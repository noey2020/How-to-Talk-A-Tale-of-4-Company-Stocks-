A Tale of Four Company Stocks, quick analysis case study.

We present in table 13-1, a summary of what the four companies were selling
for in the market at the end of 1970, and a few figures on their 1970
operations. We then detail certain key ratios, which relate on the one hand
to performance and on the other to price.

The most striking fact about the four companies is that the current
price/earnings ratios vary much more widely than their operating performance
or financial condition. Two of the enterprises ELTRA and Emhart were modestly
priced at only 9.7 times and 12 times the average earnings for 1968-1970. The
other two Emerson and Emery showed very high multiples of 33 and 45 times 
such earnings. There is bound to be some explanation of a difference such as
this, and it is found in the superior growth of the favored companiesâ€™ profits
in recent years.

Let us review briefly the chief elements of performance as they appear from
our figures.

1. Profitability. (a) All the companies show satisfactory earnings on their
book value, but the figures for Emerson and Emery are much higher than for the
other two. A high rate of return on invested capital often goes along with a 
high annual growth rate in earnings per share. All the companies except Emery
showed better earnings on book value in 1969 than in 1961; but the Emery figure
was exceptionally large in both years. (b) For manufacturing companies, the
profit figure per dollar of sales is usually an indication of comparative
strength or weakness. 

2. Stability. This we measure by the maximum decline in per-share earnings in
any one of the past ten years, as against the average of the three preceding
years. No decline translates into 100% stability, and this was registered by 
the two popular concerns.

3. Growth. The two low-multiplier companies show quite satisfactory growth
rates. The ELTRA figures are especially impressive when set against its low 
price/earnings ratio. The growth is of course more impressive for the
high-multiplier pair.

4. Financial Position. The three manufacturing companies are in sound 
financial condition, having better than the standard ratio of $2 of current
assets for $1 of current liabilities. Emery Air Freight has a lower ratio; 
but it falls in a different category, and with its fine record it would have
no problem raising needed cash. All the companies have relatively low long-term
debt. In our analysis we have made allowance for the dilution factor in the 
usual way by treating the preferred as if converted into common. This decreased
recent earnings by about 10 cents per share, or some 4%.

5. Dividends. What really counts is the history of continuance without
interruption. The best record here is Emhartâ€™s, which has not suspended a 
payment since 1902. ELTRAâ€™S record is very good, Emersonâ€™s quite satisfactory,
Emery Freight is a newcomer. The variations in payout percentage do not seem 
especially significant. The current dividend yield is twice as high on the
cheap pair as on the dear pair, corresponding to the price/earnings ratios.

6. Price History. The reader should be impressed by the percentage advance
shown in the price of all four of these issues, as measured from the lowest to
the highest points during the past 34 years.

My two cents quick analysis and thank you for reading!
